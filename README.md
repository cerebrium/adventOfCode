## Running the App

npm start --> will go and fetch the correct question for you, then display it on “http://localhost:3000/question”

`npm run ‘Your Name Here’` ie:) npm run Nick --> will run your directories index file, I plan to now start solving them, and just import the correct one into the main index file export. 

## Further Instructions
Ideally the text that is grabbed from the website and written to a file would be written to each person’s directory with the correct answer file created… if I have some more time might do this extra step, but for now I think this will do!
